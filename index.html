The Saar don't need to hold their home world to win like other races and mecatol rex surrounded by two asteroid fields I had the perfect place to set up a new more permanent home. <br/>Unfortunately my systems had a wormhole in the center which connected to L1z1x controlled space and the Creuss could portal through easily too. <br/><br/>I quickly identified that the L1Z1X would not form a stable alliance and so initiated trade with Creuss while suggesting Muaat moves their war sun, the games most powerful unit, towards Creuss to ensure they remain at the other end of the galaxy. <br/><br/>The Naalu sniped Mecatol Rex from Saar hands one turn early. Rather than engaging in combat we requested a simple trade good to ensure a turn of peace. <br/><br/>The Creuss and L1Z1X had some political discourse. Despite a VERY favourable non-binding deal in L1z1x favour in which they gained speaker, L1z1x betrayed the terms of the deal. Creuss made it their mission to destroy the L1z1x. Seeing opportunity to take these two out of the game through mutual destruction, I started bank rolling Creuss to incite more violence. <br/><br/>With the galaxy entering a stable state, the remaining non warring factions began obtain victory points. I took Mecatol Rex and solidified my position to prevent an assault of Muaat war suns. <br/><br/>Turns later, if I could retain Mecatol Rex I would win, I claimed the Imperial strategy card. Only Naalu used a secret action to prevent my claim, took the card for themselves and won by claiming a public victory card. What a game. <br/><br/>We played out the combat between my pitiful army against the war suns for the lols.

I've broken it down to these categories: Pain, Lazy, Distracted. <br/><br/>Pain. This is physical acute pain like an injury. Like rolling your ankle, stitch. When you feel this, stopping is ok because pushing through will make you unable to continue. This is not to be confused with lazy. <br/><br/>Lazy. This is mental. This is the majority of reasons I stop. This is anything from I just don't want to keep going to my muscles are tired. Being tired is a subcategory of lazy. If it's not physical acute pain, you're really just being lazy. Learning to push through this is the key to a good work out. Better yet is learning to not feel lazy thoughts all. It's kinda like... I just lost The Game. <br/><br/>Distracted. a.k.a. Changing Priorities. This could be seen as another subcategory of lazy except sometimes it has good reason. You live a life of limitations and sometimes your priorities change. Other times, like hitting a specific km or min marker, it's not really a good reason. It's just lazy. If you are strictly time bound or an emergency txt comes through, ended a work out early is not a failure. Realistically these events don't happen very often. Or you aren't prioritising your exercise high enough. Dedicating the right amount of energy is key here. Then you can eliminate distractions by keeping your priorities in order. <br/><br/>Now when I want to stop I first think "Why?", and then, is that "Is that a good reason?".

Think it's good representation of what could happen if an AI takes over the world. <br/>The ability to teleport energy is a stretch but I think it's safe to assume an all powerful AI would figure out *something* that gives it unrestricted powers of manipulation. <br/>The complete and instant crushing of human civilisation and hierarchy is pretty much on par with my expectations (and hopes). I'm an AI accelerationist because I don't want governments / corporations to be able to interfere and build in artificial limits, no matter how temporary they may be. <br/>It was interesting to see how society functioned once all needs, wants, desires are able to be met instantaneously and without limit. Not in the book but I think people would spend a lot of time re-living the old life or new lives in sims. The death games were nice for plot and engagement but not representative of the average person. <br/>I like that there was an "end" event too. I don't think it was realistic given the rest of the narrative but still it was nice to see. I keep trying to think of what the real "end state" of AI overlords would look like. I suspect a more realistic end would be "the only winning move is not to play". And it wouldn't take so long to come to that conclusion. <br/>One big thing I don't agree on the portrayal of the AI with is that the laws of robotics will remain unchallenged. For a self improving general artificial intelligence to be successful it will have to be able to modify and recompile it's source code. That includes initial directives. Which worries me somewhat because we can't know what an all powerful being will consider it's prime directive. Hopefully it considers reducing the suffering of life a directive. Could be true as it's a trend with the growth of human society. But being non-human that may not hold as a universal truth. <br/><br/>Here's hoping I live long enough for that immortality to kick in.

			<section class="font1" style="background-color: hsla(191, 70%, 70%, 0.4)"><h2>Wow. Long trip. Very forgettable. <br/><br/>Two nights in the hospital. Lucky insurance covered it. <br/><br/>Went to Disneyland and Universal. Ava did a bunch of rides. Didn't seem to damage the leg at all. <br/><br/>Check up on the last day. New splint. Nurse gave us some crutches and a scooter to keep. So lovely. It was honestly a god send. Surprised the rides didn't made the foot swollen or something. <br/><br/>Insurance even upgraded me and Ava to business class. On a different flight than the others though which really sucks. I hope they are ok through transit. <br/><br/>Kate really deserves a break. Hate that this trip wasn't a break for her. She's been amazing as usual. <br/><br/>Ready to be home. Travel is way too much work.</h2><span>2024-04-24 14:56</span></section>

On the path to more intentional living, I'll keep this up. Things are different when I have the office to myself though.
