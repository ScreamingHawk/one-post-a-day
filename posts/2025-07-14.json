Put up the tent but it was completely full of water. Decided to sleep in the car instead. Next day was sunny so we fixed up the tent. \nPlayed some board games. Cooked in the kitchen. Swam in the pool and watched the movie. Saw the dam release. \nAll in all it was a great time. Teenagers are so awkward. Neither of them really knew what they wanted. Haha. I think they had fun anyway.","createdDate":"2025-07-14","createdTime":"08:47"}
