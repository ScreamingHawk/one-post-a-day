In the truck on the road I wrote him a client management system using visual basic and microsoft access. It was a pretty shitty program in retrospect and I have no idea of he used it after that but it did fit all his requirements. He ended up offering me a share in the company if I stayed to keep working. I said no thanks I want to finish school first. \n\nHe also said not to tell his wife.
