Ouch. \nThen we went camping the next day. \nChloe and Jeremy got to see snow for the first time. Too cold but they had fun. \nHoliday park on Taupo had thermal pools and a water slide. Everyone loved movies in the pool.\nOn the way home the caravan tire explodes. AA arrives only to find our spare doesn't fit. Traveled around Taupo to get a replacement fitted. \nSo glad to be home but now it's back to the grind. Feels like it never ends. \nSomething needs to change and I feel like it's work. This all started when I left to do crypto full time. Much prefer the 9-5. \nWelp, time to unpack and do washing and dinner all at once while Kate hits a late night work conference","createdDate":"2022-07-20","createdTime":"18:04"}
