In hindsight I'm glad. Music is definitely an escape. \nI really enjoyed the experiment. Noticed that people didn't really do anything different. Instead of sitting on a device they would sit around waiting for something to happen. It's kinda the same. Think it'll take a few more attempts to truly see any benefits of the experiment. Maybe we'll make it a more frequent thing. Maybe","createdDate":"2023-01-03","createdTime":"20:10"}
