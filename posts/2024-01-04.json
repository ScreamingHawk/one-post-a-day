It was very cute. That girl is def growing up. She's already asking for a trip to Thailand. Lmao. Maybe maybe. \nChristmas!! I had a good time. We got matching xmas jumpers for the family. We did all the extended family events. I had a nap on the couch. \nBuilt the climbing wall! Now I need some tools to put the holds up. Hope I don't fall on the rocks below... \nThis had been such an awesome break. Week off and paid so I didn't have to worry about that. It was really good to have downtime and connect with the fam without having to check my PC. \nAnd I've finally come round to allowing Kate to get another cat","createdDate":"2024-01-04","createdTime":"08:01"}
