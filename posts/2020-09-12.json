HOLY SHIT! I don't know if it's just my lack of movies to compare to but this is incredible. I feel like it's validated some of my approaches to life and helped me see ways to use it for the better. I'll get into it more in another post. For now; good movie, highest of recommendations. It's slow and yet every second serves a purpose. Go into it blind. I had a spoiler that was the driver to watch it and I wish I could have experienced the movie without that I the back of my mind. So good","createdDate":"2020-09-12","createdTime":"23:01"}
