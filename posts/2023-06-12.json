Maybe that's all there is to it?\n\nEnjoying a multi course meal while away from the kids and it strike me that these restaurant set menus consider every sense except hearing. They have taste obviously, sight is the playing, smell in the meal and paired wine. Touch is the texture in the meal. But nobody puts consideration into the sounds. There's the ambiance in the restaurant soundtrack but it's not paired to the meal. I'd love a 5 sense experience that's pairs music with the meal as well. \n\nAlso I'm very drunk. I preloaded before this meal and 4 wines is already a lot to send me reeling\n\nOh so drunk","createdDate":"2023-06-12","createdTime":"15:41"}
