Sure there's the bad thing here and there but I've been thoroughly enjoying the majority. \n\nAbout a year I had an awakening. What I thought was working really wasn't. Things were bad under the surface and needed to change. \n\nThe past 6 months have been an unravelling. Taking the things that didn't work and piecing back together what few things did. Fighting more battles that needed to be fought whether I wanted to or not. All to get back to a solid foundation. \n\nI feel like that's all coming to a head. It's time to revaluate, to build, to broaden my horizons, improve and change myself. The next 6 months are going to be a period of artistry. A period of hard work, trying new things and getting out of my comfort zone. It's not going to be growth in a fixed direction. I don't know what I want but I see where things aren't working. I'm turn down the importance of old goals and system in order to discover something new. What that is. I'm not sure yet. But I'll let you know in 6 months if I found it.","createdDate":"2023-06-22","createdTime":"09:01"}
