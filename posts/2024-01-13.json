I still don't believe in a God, at least not one that gives a shit about individual humans. I do believe in the power of positive thinking and creating your own luck with intentions. \nReading \"Bared Blade\" by Kelly McCullough and the passage \"... the gods were us. Whether our evils and petty cruelties were a reflection of those who created us, or whether in some way we had created the gods we deserved through the power of our belief didn't matter. What mattered was that the Court of Heaven held no more claim to true justice than did the courts of men.\" spoke true to me. (Book 2 of 3 in a series. A fantasy adventure novel. Not about religion at all really)\nMaybe it's time to put conscious energy into curating my beliefs and figuring out who I want to be and what differences I want to make in the world.","createdDate":"2024-01-13","createdTime":"08:46"}
