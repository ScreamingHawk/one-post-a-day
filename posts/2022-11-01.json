Glad to have it off my bucket list. \nThe half was pretty fun though. That might become a regular event for me. \nAwesome that the family came out to watch me in the rain. Was cool to accidentally see people I knew along the way. \nDad showed up on his bike and gave me some good tips about hydration and sugar levels along the way. Wouldn't have survived without that. The company was very much appreciated as well.","createdDate":"2022-11-01","createdTime":"13:15"}
