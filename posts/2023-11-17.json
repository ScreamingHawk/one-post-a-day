At 830 I call and say we are watching them turn on the lights, I think that happens at 9, then heading home. She says ok me too. Lights go on at 845 and we are home by 9. After 9 I unlock her phone (it automatically locks at 9) she isn't answering calls and isn't responding to texts. At 920 I go out looking and find her by Howick village. \n\n(My understanding of) her side of the story. In the call I said I'll be home after the lights are on and after 9. She watches the lights. Hangs around for a bit. Sees her phone is in locked mode and decides since she can't call, she'll go into Howick and see Gran. Then starts walking home. \n\nWhy didn't she come home when the phone was locked? Why did she walk in the complete other direction? I hope one day when she's older we can talk about it civilly because right now I just don't understand. \nUnless it's just that she wanted to spend more time with Bob.. because that I understand but still.. \nIf she communicated, like she usually does, it would be fine. She knows and did not. \nI'm just a scared parent hoping his kid is alright.","createdDate":"2023-11-17","createdTime":"22:01"}
