I can run a half in ~2 hours but I need to ramp up. I'm going to the gym but I really need to be more consistent and get a program. Learning new knots but I forget the last when learning the next. Japanese study isn't really useful now I've stopped watched anime. Evelate is making a difference but it's sucking too much time. Likewise for chess. Maybe I should stop doing some of these things too... Hmmm","createdDate":"2022-09-12","createdTime":"13:26"}
