The whole experience has changed my perspective and let me reset. Also sleeping for 17hrs straight helped. Haha. I'll post a couple stories about it over the next few days as I think of them. Here's one\n\nOne of the C level at my work literally wrote the book on transformative psychoactive drug usage. While I was away I decided to crowd sourced a bucket list. Had an awesome chat with him about how there are so many human experiences that people can't understand until they go through them. For him the drugs were absolutely life changing and he was recommending that to me. When I asked if he had kids he said no and I was shook because it's the same thing. It's so hard to articulate why and how they give so much meaning and happiness but it's true. Probably the best chat I had all trip","createdDate":"2023-10-09","createdTime":"16:45"}
