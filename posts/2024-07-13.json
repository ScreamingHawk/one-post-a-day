Walked Ava home from her job at the Howick markets. Played dinosaurs with Jeremy. Made a quick risotto for lunch. Took everyone to the school playground. Played handball and just mucked around. Played more dinosaurs with Jeremy. Pulled some kumara out the garden for dinner. Had fish and chips. Watched half a movie with Ava. Played bananagrams with Kate. \nAva's trying a new thing where she hangs out in the communal spaces instead of in her room. Even if she's on her phone. Seems to be working. She's been in a much better mood. Could also be because things with her bf Keiran is going well. Bob used to brighten her up too. Whatever the reason, I like it.","createdDate":"2024-07-13","createdTime":"22:06"}
