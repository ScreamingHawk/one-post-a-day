And they created it for girls and invited her to be one fo the first to try it out. It's called the \"Girls Challenge Course\". It's for year 11s and gives level 2 NCEA credits. Focuses on physical and mental health + a little bit of financial literacy. Seems like an awesome course. Very excited and proud of Ava for standing up for something she believes in.","createdDate":"2024-11-01","createdTime":"12:28"}
