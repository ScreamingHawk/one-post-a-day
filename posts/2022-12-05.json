And she won the class award!!\nCelebrated by cutting her hair short and she loves the new style. Great to see her flying. \n\nAs a family we did some chaos art work. Got a big canvas and just threw paint at it to make a mess. Good stuff. Not as relaxing as I had hoped but I'm enjoying looking at it. \n\nUpdate on Cas. He now has 3 legs. He still doesn't like being inside. Tried to escape out the window. This guy is a problem. \nUpdate on online friend. It's literally the same shit as the cat.","createdDate":"2022-12-05","createdTime":"13:09"}
