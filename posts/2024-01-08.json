I'm mostly using it to practice pinches but every time I hop on the wall I want to do some balancy slab instead. Lol. Should figure out a way to make a circuit so I can just go round and round on it. Or maybe a routes that go up instead of sideways. \nFitness is going well. I'm still not happy in my skin despite being (probably) the fittest I've ever been. Should really get a program or a PT so I can start doing the right stuff instead of mucking through. I do squats, dumbell exercises and abs mostly. Climbing is all pull work so really I need to focus on more push exercises. \nRunning is good too. I can do a 10km loop around Howick/Highland Park in 55min. Not the fastest but it's very consistent and I'm happy with that. Podcasts getting boring, need more audio books.","createdDate":"2024-01-08","createdTime":"07:54"}
