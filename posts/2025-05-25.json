Have often found myself just starting a new task because it's right there in front of me. \nAlso more detail oriented, paying more attention to things as I walk past and noticing things I usually wouldn't. Even in my thinking and planning I'm going into more detail, even if I'm not going to follow through. \nPutting more effort into something doesn't come at such an energy cost. Made a nice lunch but I don't feel drained and tired. \nFood doesn't taste as good. Or, it does but I don't get the same enjoyment out of it. Crumbed fish is usually orgasmic but today it was just .. nice. \nGenerally I think I have a more positive outlook on what others are doing. I'm not bothered by the kids on games all day and just kinda plan around it. \nThe poops. \nIdk what I was expecting. It's nice. I don't think it's something I \"need\" but it might be useful to have on hand for some days. \nPlanning shrooms next weekend. Expecting a more profound experience from that.","createdDate":"2025-05-25","createdTime":"12:42"}
