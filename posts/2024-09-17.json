Instead of going hard on her we've decided to ease up and help make the bad decisions safer. A risky parenting move but we all doubt she will respond well to punishment. It didn't work last time...\n\nOn the plus side she placed 2nd in her unmarked bowhunter comp. Pretty good. \n\nAnd I highly recommend \"Notes from the burning age\" by Claire North. Her writing style really sets the vibe and keeps you guessing. The settings of all her books are very unique too. Good stuff","createdDate":"2024-09-17","createdTime":"20:14"}
