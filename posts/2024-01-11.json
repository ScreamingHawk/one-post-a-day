Asked what day would be best to have coffee catch up with a friend and Kate assumed it was at night. Told me to pick either that or climbing. Idk what that is about... Feels like a fight waiting to happen. Looking back, her expression every time I leave the house is sadness / disappointment. Even going to the gym or for a run. Well, really that's all I go out to do these days. \nHope she is ok.","createdDate":"2024-01-11","createdTime":"07:45"}
