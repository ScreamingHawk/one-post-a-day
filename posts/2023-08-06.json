She was uncontested but that's still pretty cool.  She also holds the record in the NZFAA short flint round. Also uncontested because it's the first time that round has been shot in competition. Lol. I'm still very proud. It's a badge of honour regardless","createdDate":"2023-08-06","createdTime":"16:54"}
