It's been a few days and I'm still pissed. All trust is gone. We had spoken about this before and she has deliberately disobeyed. It's happening at her mum's too. Having strangers in my house while we are asleep is honestly terrifying. \nAs a parent you are held responsible but ultimately you are powerless. My yelling constitutes a trespass notice, which I've logged with the police but if Ava invites him back it's void. \nShe's going to get herself hurt.","createdDate":"2024-06-19","createdTime":"06:52"}
