Bit scared to do stuff that will obviously involve zombies which is fine. \nBut it's painful to watch her skill issues. \nWon't use a gun because it's too hard to aim. No situational awareness. Doesn't loot items. Doesn't reload weapons. Lack of experience with level design hurts too. \nShe's still making her way through so it's fine but.. I should've trained her younger.
