That'll lead to AI taking over and humanity living forever in some form of post biological state. The biggest issue he sees is finding purpose in this new life. \nPersonally I'm on board with all that but not in our lifetime. Even if the singularity happens it'll be decades before it's blessings find a way to the average person. The rich will use any means possible to maintain their power through a class hierarchy even if it means sacrificing their own happiness and wellbeing in the short term. There's countless examples of this playing out in history. \nI don't think the worst case outcome is the Matrix like most people seem to think. I'm expecting something more like a \"happy human zoo\" akin to Brave New World. We'll live in a simulated heaven and not contribute anything of use to society. AI is going to be our great filter event if we aren't careful. But even if we fail, is the outcome really that bad?","createdDate":"2023-10-10","createdTime":"10:51"}
