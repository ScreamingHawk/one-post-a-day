Home to play Fortnite. Out to North Head to adventure in the tunnels and climb the guns. Stop in the city on the way home. Boat ride across the viaduct. Hot chocolate from McDonald's. Watch the tree get lit up. Ride a lime scooter back to the car. Looking back it actually was pretty awesome. \nNow she's sleeping and we are pulling cellotape out of the cat's asshole. lovely","createdDate":"2024-11-23","createdTime":"22:53"}
