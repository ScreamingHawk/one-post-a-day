I miss it. It does feel like an obligation to see people you wouldn't otherwise but I've become a bit of a shut in and would much rather take those opportunities. \nI'm also enjoying going to be beach and swimming in the ocean. Some of my defining teenage angsty things are slipping away. Maybe I've finally hit adulthood. Lol","createdDate":"2022-12-29","createdTime":"10:41"}
