So innocent and kind hearted. \n\nJeremy is awesome too. Convincing people he just met to make him chocolate milk and run around the house. He's the most social out of all of us. Knows what he wants and asks anyone to get it. \n\nAlso flicking the bird at Ava while disappearing down a waterslide has got to be a highlight of my trip. She's got an interesting sense of humour that girl. \n\nHaving an amazing time down here in Hawkes Bay. Warren and all his family and friends are great too. Really enjoying the vibe","createdDate":"2023-01-26","createdTime":"21:35"}
