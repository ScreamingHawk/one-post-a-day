Does your bank attest your worth? Who attests your health? Your cooking skills? Your parenting? Your love? \nWho attests that you are alive? And your worth as a person? \nIs that attestation a power you gave willingly? Can authority be revoked? \nWho truly decides what is true about you?","createdDate":"2024-11-19","createdTime":"10:35"}
