When I was younger we had the park or club or whatever. When covid hit I lost my third place. Then I got depressed (I'm only realizing this in hindsight). \nNow I have bouldering and my third place is the climbing gym. It doesn't even matter if my usual friends are there, I'll chat with anyone. And maybe not a coincidence I came right out of that depression. \nNever thought I was a social creature but I really do a lot better after social interactions outside of the home","createdDate":"2023-12-01","createdTime":"06:55"}
