The people are even better. \nI truly appreciate the opportunity and hospitality. Being able to spend days by the fire, chatting about AI philosophy and hacking code is a life I want to live. Living the high life with asado, wagyu k bbq and other luxury cuts. It's the crypto millionaire lifestyle for sure. \nI miss the fam a lot and I'm excited to go home but damn am I going to miss this.","createdDate":"2025-01-16","createdTime":"07:39"}
