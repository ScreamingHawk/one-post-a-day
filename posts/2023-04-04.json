Walked with Chloe after school to get a cinnamon scroll and look at stationary. Helped Ava with her book report on The Wave (good book. Recommend it). About to hang out with Kate when the kids are in bed. \n\nA lot of people live their live by accident, flitting from one event to the next without and conscious consideration for their time.
