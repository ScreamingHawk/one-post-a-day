Tired and grumpy at the end but def worth it. \nChloe had a blast. Running around all day living her best life. Bad mood on the way home because we kept saying no to little things. It was justified but must've got to her. Hard to be a parent. We hung out after dinner tho. Was nice. \nMiss hanging with Kate. Feels like we don't get any time together these days. No room to prioritize it either. Kids more important. Got 15min to cuddle before back to separate beds for sleep. \nMaking the most of a bad situation. It was good given all the constraints. Not quite the mindset I was hoping for but this is much nicer","createdDate":"2024-07-07","createdTime":"22:18"}
