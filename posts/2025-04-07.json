She started off climbing at her max difficulty and the stress of a packed room and hard challenges started to get to her. On her forth climb she had a slip midway and grazed her leg. Managed to finished and get the top anyway. Came down and had a panic attack, managed to calm herself down and then smash out another 5 easier climbs. She beat the Macleans girls she was hanging out with with that strategy. I'm so proud that she was able to push herself through the stressful situation and still enjoy it! Being scared and doing it anyway is an important skill to have.","createdDate":"2025-04-07","createdTime":"07:28"}
