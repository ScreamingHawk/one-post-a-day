Jumped in the car at 6am, drove to Paihia, caught the ferry across to Urupakupaku Island to hang out at Otehei Bay with Dad and his new kayaking/snorkling business. Even with the 4 hour drive it was pretty relaxing. Ava did a flip off the wharf, Chloe and Jeremy did some kayaking, Kate got her toe bitten by a snapper and I was stung by a jellyfish. All around a great time. Then we took the boat back and got pizza. Saw a waterfall the next day, drove home and had nice dinner at Mums. This is the kind of family holiday I like. Should do more things like this.","createdDate":"2024-03-25","createdTime":"07:19"}
