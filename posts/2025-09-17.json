I would get up and go. I would travel not for seeing places or things. It's only for moving. I would listen to nature. I'd go through cities. I'd steal to survive or build a garden or whatever but none of that is important. I might build a shack or break into someone's home. I might take a bike but I wouldn't take a car.
