Stuff like dirty dishes on the bench with an empty dishwasher, recycling on top of the bin instead of in it, food put away except for sauce bottles left on the table. I'm in the kitchen right now and see all of these but it extends to the entire house. Its hard to justify how the extra 5 seconds it would take to finish the task properly wasn't worth the effort.. as a one off, sure, maybe there were competing priorities that it just couldn't wait. But every day? Sheesh...\n\nWow I wasn't expecting this post to get so long lol","createdDate":"2023-09-04","createdTime":"09:35"}
