A machine exists that allows you to have limited communications between parallel universes created at the time they are switched on. Kind of like the butterfly effect, but the book focuses more on how the world reacts to the devices and challenges addicts face etc. It's very well thought out and could be the basis for so many storylines","createdDate":"2022-04-30","createdTime":"18:18"}
