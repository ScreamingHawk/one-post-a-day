You could jump around and watch the characters do there dancing and animations while singing. 2 shortened versions each of songs by Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice and Juice World. Not my kind of music but I enjoyed the atmosphere and technical skills involved in the production. Ava seemed like she was just confused. Lmao","createdDate":"2024-12-02","createdTime":"08:19"}
