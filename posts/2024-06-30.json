I did a bunch of chores and built a little tool holder. \nChloe and I went to the library and had some quality time. She's really enjoying handball. It takes me back. She still doesn't really understand the rules but it's fine because we have fun just hitting the ball around. \nJeremy wants to play but he finds it more fun being annoying. He's very good at playing by himself. Not so good when playing someone else's game. \nAva didn't want to do anything together. As usual. Her walking is getting heaps better though. She's still slow and quick to tire but way better than she has been. \nGot so many chores and kids things to do tomorrow I might have to take the day off just to manage them since Kate is sick again. We'll see. 9.30 so time to sleep","createdDate":"2024-06-30","createdTime":"21:30"}
