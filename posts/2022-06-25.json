NYC is an awesome city once you get over the scent. I'll definitely be visiting again to do all the touristy things. Was nice to have a break from the kids too. I've got a massive sleep debt that I hope to pay before we pick them up from the grandparents.\nBtw I have covid. Lol","createdDate":"2022-06-25","createdTime":"07:00"}
