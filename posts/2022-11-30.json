He's been hanging out at an empty house, chilling on the deck chairs by the pool, watching the birds. Only found him because their neighbour has photos of Cas on her desk at work. Her colleague saw our Facebook post. \nTook him to after hours vet. He stayed there two nights. Compound fracture in his leg. It can't be saved. Amputation is tomorrow morning. Poor boy...\n\nAlso our online friend Gecko has psychosis. He's completely lost his grip on reality. Thinks the AI is out to get him and he discovered the meaning of life through a video game. He's maxed his credit card by staying at a hotel and burning all his money on PC gear. His IRL friends are unable or unwilling to go see him. Being around his family is like torture to him. There's nothing we can do all the way from little NZ. We tried calling people and the hotel and him but nothing is working. It's heartbreaking. \n\nWhat a week... At least Chloe has her dance this weekend. Hopefully things will start looking up as Christmas rolls through\n\nHeard another good quote: Luck is the intersection between hard work and opportunity","createdDate":"2022-11-30","createdTime":"13:58"}
