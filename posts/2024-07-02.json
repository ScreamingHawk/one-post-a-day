Then i have time to meal prep and do a couple chores. \nYesterday I watched Chloe's cross country (she did amazing! 11th). Cleaned the inside of the car. Took Ava to therapy for her first time. Then we got Starbucks. Picked the younger two up and Ava's bf. Took them to Botany for a date. Dropped the littlies home then drove an hr to drop the bf home. \nToday did the washing and vacuuming. Taking kids to swimming class next. Then another pick up for Ava. \nIt's very calming when everyone is in a decent mood.","createdDate":"2024-07-02","createdTime":"15:12"}
