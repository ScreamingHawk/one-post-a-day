The past 2 years I've not asked for a pay rise. Though I have asked for stock incentives. Maybe that's a sign I need some introspection on my role. I do love the freedom that this job brings. The technology is interesting and the challenges are fun. But I do feel the loneliness, a lack of accountability and a disregard for deadlines. I don't want to do this forever, but I don't know what else I do want to do. In the end will it really be any different elsewhere?","createdDate":"2025-10-22","createdTime":"08:54"}
