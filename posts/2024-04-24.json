Ava did a bunch of rides. Didn't seem to damage the leg at all. \n\nCheck up on the last day. New splint. Nurse gave us some crutches and a scooter to keep. So lovely. It was honestly a god send. Surprised the rides didn't made the foot swollen or something. \n\nInsurance even upgraded me and Ava to business class. On a different flight than the others though which really sucks. I hope they are ok through transit. \n\nKate really deserves a break. Hate that this trip wasn't a break for her. She's been amazing as usual. \n\nReady to be home. Travel is way too much work.","createdDate":"2024-04-24","createdTime":"14:56"}
