They still embellish the animation but now all the fights are actually accurate to real life gameplay. Unlike the original where they could tell the beyblades to move somehow. I've been watching some of the competitions and learning about the different combos, launch strategies and type affinities. The new rail system makes attacks way more exciting too. Even found a store that sells my old Driger blade I used to love. Guess what I'm getting for Christmas?","createdDate":"2025-11-20","createdTime":"13:40"}
