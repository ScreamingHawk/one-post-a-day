NSFW warning..\nKate and I spent the weekend at a festival called Naked in the Trees. It's a sex positive clothing optional festival with DJs, exhibitions and workshops. We had the absolute time of our lives. We have been exploring that side of sexuality for a while and it's been working well for us but this was something else. \nWe connected with each other in a way we never had before. The people, the vibe, the location, everything about the event was perfect (except the food actually). I even danced sober! For hours! \nI feel like I've grown more in that weekend than I have in years. I can't wait to go back and do it all over again. 2025 is turning out to be the best year.","createdDate":"2025-02-18","createdTime":"21:59"}
