I've broken it down to these categories: Pain, Lazy, Distracted. \n\nPain. This is physical acute pain like an injury. Like rolling your ankle, stitch. When you feel this, stopping is ok because pushing through will make you unable to continue. This is not to be confused with lazy. \n\nLazy. This is mental. This is the majority of reasons I stop. This is anything from I just don't want to keep going to my muscles are tired. Being tired is a subcategory of lazy. If it's not physical acute pain, you're really just being lazy. Learning to push through this is the key to a good work out. Better yet is learning to not feel lazy thoughts all. It's kinda like... I just lost The Game. \n\nDistracted. a.k.a. Changing Priorities. This could be seen as another subcategory of lazy except sometimes it has good reason. You live a life of limitations and sometimes your priorities change. Other times, like hitting a specific km or min marker, it's not really a good reason. It's just lazy. If you are strictly time bound or an emergency txt comes through, ended a work out early is not a failure. Realistically these events don't happen very often. Or you aren't prioritising your exercise high enough. Dedicating the right amount of energy is key here. Then you can eliminate distractions by keeping your priorities in order. \n\nNow when I want to stop I first think \"Why?\", and then, is that \"Is that a good reason?\". If it's not, I keep going and up the tempo","createdDate":"2023-11-09","createdTime":"17:39"}
