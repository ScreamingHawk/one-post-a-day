Whenever I go over to her place we chat about her garden and she made the offhand comment that she wanted compost for Christmas since she can't drive anymore and no one has taken her to Bunnings to get some. Say no more! She was so excited on the day that she kept bringing it up randomly, saying that she was so excited to go home and use it. Apparently she's even been telling her friend about it.
