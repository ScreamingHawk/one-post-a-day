He wouldn't come back to the hospital. \nWhen she woke up she saw was in immense pain, saw everything through a blood red filter and heard the screams groans and cries from other patients in the ward. She literally thought she died and woke up in hell. \nShe still says if she could go back she would have pulled the plug and not lived through it. \nHoly shit.
