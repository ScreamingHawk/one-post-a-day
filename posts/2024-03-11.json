The CEO is an amazing dev so he has good insights but he's humble enough to know our lead is better. \nThen I see comments like:\nC: Will take your lead. You know best. \nD: I don't think you believe that really. But that's fine I will keep doing what I do. \nC: You'll see what I'm talking about once we get there. And if I'm wrong I'll happily admit and buy you a beer. \nI believe it too. CEO has strong opinions but also a great respect for the team. Good culture","createdDate":"2024-03-11","createdTime":"07:51"}
