Will it flow as a circular river or a river that dumps into an open body of water. It all depends on where you direct it to go. It ebbs and flows according to your instruction. How you form your code is up to you, but remember, the code you ship will be your signature, your calling card. It will represent you. Your code is like a form of unique identity. It reflects your style and your attitude. There will be some trademark aspects of how you code and you will see those aspect across many projects. Your code is a natural extension of your being. Its how you think and how you breath. You tell it what to do, and it just does it. Unapologetically.","createdDate":"2021-08-17","createdTime":"12:39"}
