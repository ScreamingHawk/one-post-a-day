When someone orders from your store, you take their order to Bunnings, show your prices and get a further 10%. That's your profit. You don't have to hold any stock and every sale is guaranteed profit. \nUse tricks like maximum basket size and long expensive delivery fees to reduce volume through your store. Refund orders you don't want to fill. \nYour website costs will be trivial because they can scrape Bunnings in real time to get the price. No database required. \nWonder if I can make this in a weekend","createdDate":"2023-12-10","createdTime":"08:54"}
