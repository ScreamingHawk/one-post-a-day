It's at rainbows end. Was going to be a big one because he's turning 5. \nSeems like every week something new that's big and bad happens. Need to flip the mindset and think of some positives. \nWas nice to see Ashley. Hes going through his own stuff but keeping well. Had some nice one on one time with Chloe too. She's a treasure. Finding joy researching 3d printing. Keen to start that new hobby. \nFrom here on out things turn around. Mark my words.","createdDate":"2024-07-06","createdTime":"21:07"}
