Somehow I managed to come right enough for two days, Christmas and an island hike. I'm still sick. The flu probably, and conjunctivitis. Also my tooth is hammering me all of a sudden... It's not even the tooth I have scheduled at the dentist on Weds.. And I doubt I'll make that appointment when I'm still this sick. But God damn I need something. \nAt least it's the first day of work.. Hahahaha","createdDate":"2026-01-05","createdTime":"10:05"}
