It feels like I'm doing something wrong but idk.. she gets so in her head about not feeling like she belongs and then rebuffs any attempts to belong. \nI'm doing my best to ride it out. She'll be off on her own life journey in a couple years. \nI remember myself being much the same but it must have been easier without having to organize primary school kids at the same time.","createdDate":"2025-02-08","createdTime":"15:21"}
