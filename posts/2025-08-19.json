Even Cas came in and chose to sleep on Jeremy's bed. \nMade a berry and chai compote. Pretty good. \nSpent some time just chilling with no devices or other entertainment. Just peace and quiet. So relaxing. \nFound another bug in my smart sessions at work though. That imposter syndrome is creeping back in. Still working on that one","createdDate":"2025-08-19","createdTime":"21:26"}
