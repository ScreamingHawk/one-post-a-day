There's going to be a lot of information I miss because I'm busy typing. And correcting my mistakes. Blankly staring at the keyboard. I'm waiting for thoughts to come. What else is in here. It's a cavern. Remembering that time I nearly drowned in the cave. It's a good story. Character building. I'd like to be better at writing. I struggle to formulate words and put it to paper. There's gaps when I'm thinking. I trail off without finishing a thought. Even when a new thought doesn't come. Two minutes down. Five minutes is a long time. I like dark mode. It's soothing. Mistyped. Mistyping. Do I repeat my writing when my thoughts repeat. Should I be fixing three minutes my mistakes. What about when thoughts overlap my writing. This is a strange process. I need more rules. I need to type faster. But sometimes there's nothing. My mind is blank. But it isn't really. I repeat internally. Struggling. Not really struggling just unsure. I'm always rounding numbers. Four minutes. Not five. Why do I keep looking at the clock. Am I waiting for it to end. I'm craving distractions. Tiktok isn't so bad. It might be. I'm doom scrolling. It's not a good use of my time. I want to be exercising. I don't enjoy it. I like the results. I'm hitting five minutes as I check the time again. That's it. \n\nThat was an interesting experiment. It kind of sucked though... Need to set the stage for my brain before I start this. Maybe have a topic in mind. And don't time it visibly. Have an alarm or something instead","createdDate":"2023-05-24","createdTime":"11:08"}
