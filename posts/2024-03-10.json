She's still grappling with the idea that changing every part of herself would not be her, but she agrees when it's a boat. It's fun trying to reason when changes make you someone else or not. \nHas got me reconsidering if I would be ok being uploaded to the cloud. I do believe that I'm not the same person I was 10 years ago. I may have a lot of the same components and attributes but I'm not the same. I wouldn't want the brain upload to be sudden but I do think if the copy is significantly similar then it would be more or less the same me that I would be in the real world. That's to say neither would be the me I am today. And that would be ok. \nTaking it to the logical extreme, I'm a different person with different motives, aspirations and physicality with every passing electrical impulse. The rules that define me yesterday are not the same that dictate my actions today. \nRight now, I'm a bit hungry.","createdDate":"2024-03-10","createdTime":"09:34"}
